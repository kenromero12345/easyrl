EasyRL is reinforcement learning environments and agents learning application to help non-programmers learn RL.
This is converted from a Python GUI to a web application for easier usability for the users.

This is for "EasyRL: A Simple and Extensible Reinforcement Learning Framework‚Äù that has been accepted to the AAAI-21 Demonstrations program.
